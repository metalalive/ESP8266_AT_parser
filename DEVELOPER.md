### Brief introduction of software design of this AT-command parser

This ESP AT-command parser runs with 2 seperate tasks (threads), and one interrupt service routine (ISR in short) :
* Request-handling task : handles incoming AT command request sent by API calls, generates low-level command raw bytes and then send then out to ESP8266 device.
* Response-handling task : processes raw response string received from ESP8266 device, extracts meaningful data from the received string, and pass them back to API function calls.
* ISR : when the AT-command raw bytes are transmitted to ESP device, our parsing software will wait until the ESP device transmits  variable number of bytes as response of the AT command back to host CPU, as soon as number of raw bytes (part of response data) are ready in the DMA Rx buffer of the underlying hardware platform, the DMA is expected to signal interrupt to the host CPU, then the host CPU switches to the ISR, starts copying the received raw bytes from DMA Rx buffer to the buffer structure internally defined / used in this ESP AT parser, let the response-handling task process the raw bytes later.

The ISR works closely with the 2 tasks, and it communicates with DMA (Direct Memory Access controller) / UART modules, which are essential in your underlying hardware platform.

### Basic usage 
Here is quick overview of the API functions which would be frequently called in user applications :
* ```espRes_t   eESPinit( espEvtCbFn cb )``` : Initialize ESP AT-command parser, this function creates threads that work together to handler AT command requests generated by other API functions call, also a couple of data structure for internal use like mutex, semaphore (for thread synchronization), and message boxes (for communication between these threads). Where ```espEvtCbFn cb``` is an event callback that is globally used in this AT-command parser
  
* ```espRes_t    eESPresetWithDelay( uint32_t dly_ms, const espApiCmdCbFn cb , void* const cb_arg )``` : reset ESP device with given milliseconds. The optional arguments ```espApiCmdCbFn cb``` and ```void* const cb_arg ``` are API callback function pointer and the callback's argument, they take effect after reset is done.
